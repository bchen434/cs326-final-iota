## Innovative Idea

Our idea is to create a website with the ultimate goal of allowing users to track their media intake and become better informed with regards to the amount of media they are consuming. This includes things like books, music, movies, tv shows, but could be extended to any other kind of media form. Additionally, the analytics for watch time, read time, listen time, etc. could help people to realize their media viewing habits and correct them if they decide to.

Our website is similar to services like [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) for books, [Last.fm](https://Last.fm) for music, and [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) for movies. However, there seems to be a vacuum for services that do all of these forms of media at once. This versatility will allow users to not have mental overhead in remembering to update several services at once. This all-in-one approach could also lead to several analytics that could be interesting to users (comparing watch time and reading time, etc).



## Important Components

The most essential component to our system is the ability for users to maintain lists of media they are currently using, planning to use or have completed. Each user will have an account (or perhaps we will utilize cookies) that will maintain these distinct lists persistently. It is our hope that if users choose, these lists could be made public to share with friends or anyone in general.

Secondary to the list compoenent is our analytics component. Put simply, we would like to allow users to track several aspects of their media consumption. This could help people to realize their media intake is too high, or conversely, to help people reach goals like reading a certain amount of books per year. In doing this, we hope to be able to penultimately create a 'trending near you' option, which would allow users to see media that is popular in their area.
