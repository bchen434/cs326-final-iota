## Innovative Idea

Our idea is to create a website with the ultimate goal of allowing users to track their media intake and become better informed with regard to the amount of media they are consuming. This includes things like books, music, movies, tv shows, and can be extended to other forms of media. Additionally, the analytics for watch time, read time, listen time, etc., could help people to realize their media viewing habits and adjust accordingly.

Our website is similar to services like [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) for books, [Last.fm](https://Last.fm) for music, and [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) for movies. However, there is a vacuum for services that do all of these forms of media at once. This versatility will allow users to not have mental overhead in remembering to update several services at once. This all-in-one approach allows for unique analytics such as comparing watch time to reading time.



## Important Components

The most essential component to our system is the ability for users to maintain lists of media they are currently using, planning to use, or have completed. Each user will have an account that will maintain these distinct lists persistently. With the user's permission, these lists can be made public to share with friends. Secondary to the list component is our analytics component. We will utilize the user data to create a meaningful presentation of their media consumption habits. This could help people to realize their media intake is too high, or conversely, to help people reach goals like reading a certain amount of books per year.
